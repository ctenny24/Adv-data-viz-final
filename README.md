# Adv-data-viz-final
## Final Project for Advanced Data Visualization Course at Pratt

Using Restaurant Data provided by Yelp Open Dataset, this data exploration investigates how COVID-19 impacted restaurants in Philadelphia and in comparison to other major cities.

The pandemic was an earthshattering event that impacted everyone's lives for more than year and specific industries, such as the restaurant and hospitality, still feel the financial and cultural tremors as result of this world wide event.

In this exploration, I aim to answer:
  1. What variables can best measure Covid's impact on restaurants in Philly?
  2. How did Covid impact these restaurants quantifiably?
  3. How did Philly stand in comparison to other major cities (i.e. Tucson and Indianapolis)?
